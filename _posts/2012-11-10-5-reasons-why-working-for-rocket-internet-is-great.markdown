It has been 16 months since I started working for [Rocket Internet](http://www.rocket-internet.de) - first in Berlin, then in Istanbul, and now in Dubai. I can admit that joining this company was one of the key decisions I've made so far in my life. Albeit not the easiest one since I was 4 days away to move to London when Rocket approached me. The next day I had the job. I remember it was an eventful and adventurous week for me, a story I still catch myself excitedly telling.

You may have read some articles about this organization already, most probably negative. I would like to point out some of the good experiences I had with Rocket. I definitely had lots of bad ones, but I will write about those later, maybe when I leave.

## 1- Intensive Work Experience

The main characteristic of Rocket is for sure its rocket speed in execution. This is actually true for anything it is doing, if it is founding, hiring, launching or even [closing](http://venturevillage.eu/rocket-internet-to-shut-down-turkey-operations). In my presence the Turkey & MENA branch launched 8 ventures within 5 months. I was involved in 4 of these. With the tool chain Rocket provides, we can launch a venture in a single week, from technical point of view.

The real and hard work actually starts after launching the website. It is the basic requirement for everyone to start rocking. Marketing, Content, Merchandising, Operations, Customer Service etc. at the same time. It literally feels like being in time-lapse video. You see the business building from A to Z. 

With intensive I definitely mean the wide experience you gain, but also the pressure you have every day. It is a challenging and demanding work environment. Issues other businesses face in a year, you face in a month and solve them in the same.

There is a running gag of the exponential discrepancy between how long it is and how long it feels for someone working for Rocket.

## 2- Pioneer Work in New Markets

It is for sure that Rocket does not do rocket science, nor holds a record in innovation. However no one can ignore the fact that they  enter markets the originals would never enter. I love Amazon and was very loyal back in Germany. It is great. It was so normal for me to have Amazon. When I moved to Istanbul I was lost. "What? No Amazon here???". It took me a while to trust other sites but I still missed the Amazon experience. How long do you think will it take until Amazon is in Nigeria, Libya, Egypt or in Indonesia? I don't think it will happen in this decade. For someone in Europe and US adopting the Amazon model may sound unethical, certainly for people in those lost countries it is great and welcomed.

Adopting a business model may also sound easy from outside. Nevertheless executing that model is very hard in a market and region which is not developed yet. All kind of payment methods? Fully automated dispatch of order? Next day delivery? Free shipping? Addresses and post-codes? When Rocket starts a business in such markets, they need to start from zero. So the main things they need(ed) to do is education. The most common question to the customer service is, where our shop is located at. It is very common that customer service instructs people how to buy online. However education does not end with customers. They also need to educate our partners in logistics, suppliers, service providers and whatsoever so they go the right way to achieve the European standards.

This education of customer and infrastructure is also good for competitors and the region itself. Additionally it is an education of employees. Especially in my department I can say that my team worked with such an enterprise solution the first time. That is why ex-Rocket employees are so demanded.

Furthermore having Rocket Internet entering a region boosts the e-commerce scene there and makes it interesting for other investors. Therefor I have seen other e-commerce startups being happy about Rocket. If that Rocket venture succeeds, the e-commerce scene will benefit from it in long term. If it does not, as seen with Rocket Turkey and Mizado, than it is definitely negative for the scene, as other investors will be more cautious before investing in this region.

## 3- Wide Network

Rocket has created thousands of jobs with more than 50 ventures over the globe. In combination with the head quarters, regional offices and ventures you find a wide network of professionals. In my experience, maintaining good relationships and having a network is the best recipe for a good career. You never know when you need someone and you never know when someone needs you.

With this network you have also access to best practices, solutions and experiences. As all these ventures use the same tool chain you can easily adopt something they did to your venture. The same tool chain makes you valuable for Rocket, as it costs energy, time and money for them to have experienced people in that. Once you have this experience, you are interesting for any of these ventures. You can literally point your finger on a world map and ask yourself, "how about working there?".

## 4- Rocket Your Career

Human resources are limited. Rock(et) star people are even more limited. Expansion and execution requires a good team. Especially with the rocket speed, it is not easy to find talents immediately. It is far more likely that people experienced in Rocket's tool chain get promoted to fill a new opening than someone from outside. Except founder, MD and Entrepreneur-in-Residence (EIR) roles, it does not matter where you went to college. What matters is what you did before and if you are going to add value. Once you are in and do great job, you have good cards for your next promotion.

However here is one crucial thing. Working for Rocket is risky. It is actually as much risky as with other startups. But due to the speed it seems to be more. If you are a father of five, sponsor your parents, grandparents and have a mortgage, do not start working for Rocket. If you are young and flexible, go for it.

## 5- Interpersonal Lessons for Life

I wrote above that working for Rocket is challenging and demanding. The pressure can lead you or others to crude behavior. You will need to deal with mistakes and failures but also successes.

Especially building up a big team with hierarchy from scratch, things won't work smoothly immediately. There will be strains between manager and employee, senior and junior, colleagues, departments and so far.

It is a very dynamic work environment. It is no easy but you will learn and benefit for your life. Success is actually more hard to deal with than failures. With failure most likely you know what caused it, you may know what to do better next time. You may learn how NOT to run a company. You will learn how big the name and organization is, in the end it's just humans. Nothing is below you, nothing is above you.
