In February 2012 I was put in charge of building a new development team for Rocket Internet in Dubai. Although I have been participating in the hiring process before, it was my first time to manage from A to Z. I made some thoughts in the beginning and worked out a process I sticked to. I am going to write about this experience addressing both recruiters and applicants soon. Today I am sharing my objections on the resumes I looked through.

I have reviewed over 150 curricula vitae (CVs) within a few weeks and have seen too many bad examples to not speak about. When I review a CV, I look and hope that they do not do the mistakes below. I'd like to mention that I don't disqualify resumes just on these but it definitely influences my gut feeling.

Speaking of CVs, I am not a big fan of traditional ones. I believe that a duly completed [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) or [Stackoverflow Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com) profile with recommendations is far more valuable and informative for the recruiter. The following rules are also valid for such online resumes.

## Punctuation, Capitalization Mistakes and Typos

I don't believe that you can get a job as a journalist, author or writer with full of typos and mistakes in your CV. Some people may say that programmers do not fall into this category. Same as writers, programmers write text to accomplish their daily work. They rarely have the writer's block so they continuously work like this. Programmers need to write way more carefully as any typo can immediately break something. Software faults (bugs) cost money, it can seriously harm a company (see [Ariane 5](http://www.around.com/ariane.html)). I say, they do not fall into the same category but into a similar one.

I know that English is not the primary language of almost all applicants. I am not a native speaker as well. Therefore I am not looking for tiny grammar or vocabulary faults. What I am looking for is **consistency**. I am fine if someone does not know how to write this and that. But I am not fine with randomly used variants of the mistake or word such as multi-lingual, multilingual, multi linguel, Multilingual.

Be cautious with brand and skill names you are selling to the recruiter. You are supposed to work with them regularly and know that skill. If you are a LAMP programmer and don't know how to write Mysql, Php, lynux, Apachi (intendedly written wrong), then we have a problem, don't we?

I also do not understand the different variants of punctuation applicants use in their resumes. I can say that 50% of these 150 candidates , I've reviewed,do not know how to use punctuation .:; Isn't this scaring for a programmer job where punctuation and delimiters are very crucial?

## Messy Layout

Did you know that programmers are designers, too? Some design the architecture of the software, others the data model. Many think in design patterns. They transfer the complex real world problem or solution into lines of code, or, simpler a data value into a data type. It's the same with CVs. We have bunch of information which needs to be reflected on paper. We have headlines, lists, dates, full text etc. In example we group all work experiences together, use the same format for all headlines. I could continue with examples.

Anyway I expect programmers in my team to write clean, readable and brief code. In my opinion I can expect the same from candidates for their CVs.

Write your work experience from most recent to oldest. For each position, give a brief intro to the company you worked for as well as the project. Then provide some of YOUR highlights during that position as well as how the team worked (methodologies). What matters is what you did in the last 2 years, the rest is just for confirmation. Therefore keep the most recent position descriptions detailed and the rest brief.

## Weeds of Skills

Less is more. Do not yield to your temptation to add more and more skills you have (or just heard of).

Only mention skills you are confident and comfortable with  recruiters asking you questions about or even cross-examining you. You can imagine that the disappointment is much higher on their side than not seeing that skill on your resume at all.

I once had a CV for a non-programmatic role where the applicant claims to have PHP6 experience. At that time (and at the time I post this article) PHP6 is not released. I do not expect it to be released in 2013. When I approached him with that fact, he insisted that PHP6 is released. I found out that he read a book about PHP6. Actually I even know that book, it has been published before the release and has been renamed afterwards.

## Microsoft Word File Format

Send your CV in PDF format. More than 50% of the candidates' CVs were in Microsoft Word (.doc) format. Word documents take longer to load on the recruiter's computer and do not guarantee that the document is displayed same across devices. The first impression counts. If the recruiter opens the attachment on mobile or uses Quick Look (document preview feature on Mac OS X) then it can be completely messed up. Even on the computer it can differ. Do not expect that the receiver of your CV has Microsoft Office installed (again it looks different with OpenOffice or LibreOffice).

You may like to keep the original copy as a Word document. Headhunters usually request CVs in that format.

## Fancy Email Addresses

Take care that you have an email address with your name and avoid words or figures which may be registered negatively (e.g. megaturk or filipinolover).

As I was looking for web developers, I was highly surprised that  only a handful candidates had their own domains. The first things web workers I know do, is registration of domains for themselves. Even if they use Google Mail, they know how to configure it to work with their Google Mail account.

Do not forget to include your LinkedIn profile. If the recruiter checks that profile out then you can most likely see that on LinkedIn. Also the recruiter can see recommendations and mutual connections. If your Twitter profile does not contain awkward tweets, you may want to share it too.

## Bonus tip: GitHub Profile

In case someone asks you to share your Github profile if you have one, do not take it as command to create a new clean empty Github profile. It shows that you did not understand the reason behind the question which is that he or she would like to have a look into your open source projects and your contributions. You also do not need to tell me that you don't have one but going to create and send me the profile name tomorrow morning (happened maybe two dozen times).

## Good luck

When you're finished, give it a night and then go through your CV once again. Look for typos and other mistakes. Try to find unnecessary sentences and remove them.

In case you are a job seeker, I wish you good luck with it. I believe that everyone can easily find a job. It is more a matter of landing an awesome job than an average or worse one, isn't it?

In any case I appreciate feedback and your thoughts. What is your kick-ass tip? What was the worst thing you've seen in a CV?  Anyone still has a CV of them 10 years ago or older? What do you think about it?
