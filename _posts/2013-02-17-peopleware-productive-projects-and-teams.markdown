Being in the technology sector where a book written in 2012 may be already considered outdated, I was very surprised when I read "[Peopleware: Product Projects and Teams](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932633439/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0932633439&linkCode=as2&tag=halkok-20)" by [Tom DeMarco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_DeMarco) and [Timothy Lister](http://www.amazon.com/Timothy-Lister/e/B000APBT96). This book was first published in 1987. Well, to be correct I read the second edition from 1999. Hell, it's still too old. But it does not matter when it is written, what only matters is what you read and capture from it for yourself. This masterpiece is as relevant today as when it was written and should be mandatory for any IT manager.

I was first going to write a review about it, but soon realized that it would be miserable. I felt every second sentence in all 245 pages was too relevant not to be quoted. Maybe I should memorize all of it so I could give my manager a talking-to next time when he complains about the productivity and efficiency of the team, I thought. However you may want to read [Cool Tool's summary](http://kk.org/cooltools/archives/001248) of Peopleware. I'd like to quote the first paragraph here:
<!-- more -->
> Hard-won wisdom fills this small book: How to create a team, place, or company that is productive. First published 20 years ago, and updated once since then, copies of it have quietly served as a guru for many start ups and successful projects in Silicon Valley. Neither academic nor faddish, two veteran consultant authors offer real intelligence. This book has totally informed how I do projects. I learned about the myth of overtime, the need for closure and ceremonies, how teams jell, and why everyone should and can have a window. I first read it decades ago and re-read it every time I embark on anything involving more than one person and several years of my life. Unlike a lot of management lore, it is aimed at the project level (where I want to be) rather than the large organization. The message in the book touts productivity, without ever mentioning the dreary idea of time management. Itâ€™s more about optimizing people, and thus the title, Peopleware.

Nonetheless I'd still like to outline two topics: Office Environment and Cost of Replacement.

## Office Environment

The authors raise this topic based on the uniform cubicle office environments back in the 80s, where a huge number of employees are put each into a small cube with plastic walls and no windows. It was the first time I noticed that it's actually a quite old book. Being young, I only know these kind of offices from US movies. However after some time I realized that this topic is in fact still recent. 

The cubicles have evolved and have a new name: open office. It is actually like cubicles just without the walls with even less privacy. Open offices are praised to be very productive and cool. It is in and managers are very proud of it. You'll find it as a selling point in job descriptions and career pages. "Sit together with the CEO and Vice Presidents!", they said. They didn't say that the CEO always has Skype calls and other matters  which require him to sit in the meeting room the whole day. It is not about coolness and startup feeling, it's about cost efficiency. Wait, read Peopleware and you'll see it's not cost efficient at all.

In our first retrospectives with a new established development team, we did not hear any complains about the work and project itself. But we heard all complaining about noise and less space, so less that they get hit by peers just trying to make their way through the jungle. Imagine you were just understanding an algorithm when you get hit and shaken. It is already so difficult to get into the flow in this noise and once you achieve it one or two times a day, you get disrupted.

## Cost of Replacement

Cost of replacement is something I believe only very few managers think of. If they'd know this, they would mobilize anything in there hands to keep the staff happy.

In medium to big as well as legacy projects it can take up to 2 or 3 months until an engineer is ready to take full tasks. It is not even known when they really get confident about the project.  During this not only their time get useless but also partially their peers introducing them to the project. You can easily consider minimum of two month salaries as cost of replacement.

Sometimes when you have resource bottlenecks, you may hear from managers saying: "But this front end guy, Peter was his name right?, he is going to start next week. You should be fine then!". Or "Cannot we just hire someone for this task?".
