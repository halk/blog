It's time to say goodbye to [Dubai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai) and the [United Arab Emirates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates). On 28th Feb, my wife and me are going on a new adventure, traveling to few places and eventually joining an interesting new startup. Exactly one year ago as I am writing this post, I was sitting in the airplane from Istanbul to Dubai, with a new mission but no real idea what was expecting me. Looking back it was my best life experience so far.

After so many sunny days in the emirate, my wife and me have fallen in love with it, a fact we never expected. Before coming to Dubai, I had a quite negative opinion about it for long time, although I never visited it. I confess that I was biased and believed the stories about the artificiality and extremes. When I heard about friends spending their honeymoons in the emirate, I could not understand the reason why they chose Dubai. I told my wife, then fianc√©, that I'd never consider Dubai for honeymoon. I ended up doing exactly the opposite. This is definitely one of the lessons I learned from Dubai: not to prejudice. I spent the first months of my beloved in this city. I won't ever forget it.

Dubai is a beautiful, clean and safe place with hundreds of activity choices for everyone, guaranteed sun coupled with a relaxed and hassle-free lifestyle (given that you have already completed the whole visa process), people from literally every corner in the world and tasty halal food from any cuisine you can imagine. I will definitely miss the food that I currently take every chance visiting favorite places before going. I am kind of prepared for the comments on my weight when landing in Germany. I really liked going on desert safaris with the own car and climbing of up to hundred meter high dunes which I think feels almost like climbing a mountain.

The year as [Chief Technical Officer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer) at [Rocket Internet](http://www.rocket-internet.de) and [Namshi](http://www.namshi.com) was by far my most challenging but enjoyable work experience. I met so many nice people with interesting stories. I learned a ton as much with failures as with successes. I want to thank everyone I met here especially the development team of Namshi. Without you guys, I would not have been successful. I was thinking to mention all those I'd like to thank particularly but I am afraid that I forget someone.

Dubai, thank you so much. [Sharjah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharjah_%28emirate%29), I love you too!
