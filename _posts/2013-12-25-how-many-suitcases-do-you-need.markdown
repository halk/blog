This morning on Christmas day, when many others are unpacking their gifts and new possessions, I read an [article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2503328/Craziest-OkCupid-date-Couple-21-day-European-trip.html) about a couple travelling through Europe for three weeks without any luggage but one set of clothing. This made me think about some of the experiences we made in the last three years in which we moved four times across countries - Germany, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United States and the United Kingdom. We usually stayed at one location for a few months only, the longest being a year, but every time we thought we are going to stay there for a medium or long time. So we ended up buying stuff which we needed to get rid of again.

Moving across countries is usually a long and expensive process for many expats. One of the difficult points of emigration is finding a job. I had the luck that either my employer assigned me there or I already found an employer before deciding to move. When I moved from Berlin to Istanbul, I already knew in advance that I was going to move but not when. So I had just packed for five days and travelled by train from the other side of Germany to Berlin. On Monday evening I got told that I need to be in Turkey and I took the plane on the morrow. I had no idea where I would stay that night.

The most contemplative revelation for me and later my wife was  to which level someone can shrink their belongings. This year our belongings were literally squeezed into one large, one medium and two carry-on suitcases. Except for a few times when we did the mistake to book our air tickets at budget airlines, we never exceeded our baggage allowance. The revealing part was that you can get rid of almost anything and start over. Our suitcases were basically filled with clothing, so we could have gone even further and shrunk it to one or two carry-on bags. Clothing can be bought again. Every time we started over, we had no real urge to buy new things. The only things we were eager to buy were kitchen utensils and bedding goods. In Germany we were already used to IKEA and it was quite convenient to find it also in the UAE, US and UK. 

However we eventually found possessing stuff to be a burden each time when we decided to move on. In Dubai we put our stuff on [Dubizzle](http://www.dubizzle.com/), the leading local classifieds website in the Middle East - our apartment literally resembled a bazaar with people bargaining with us. Although being Turkish we are not good in bargaining so we always ended up giving it for too cheap, but again the motivation was more to get rid of them rather than getting money. In the US we put them on [Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.org/) which did not went that well. We only sold a few things, in the end we donated them. In 2009, my parents moved to a small apartment from a house where they and partially half dozen children lived for sixteen years. During that time so much stuff gathered in any corner of the house and it was hard work to separate unneeded stuff out. Luckily the apartment had a basement which was not the case for all places I lived in the last three years. So I think it is sometimes a blessing to force yourself to regularly part with unneeded stuff.

The only annoying part for me was dealing with local banks. Being new in a country, you usually have to wait to get credit cards or other facilities. With using your foreign cards you may end up with high fees on your statement. Once I withdrew cash with my UAE credit card and they charged me ~$60 (AED 225) for a single transaction, so more than I actually withdrew. And it is also not fun to fulfil obligations on your accounts abroad. I am still doing the splits to maintain balances in my German and UAE accounts.

Finally I am glad to have gone through this experience. Many friends of mine desire moving away or returning to their home country but do not find the courage to go through the process. As long as they find a job there and manage their language, I think it is really not a big deal.
