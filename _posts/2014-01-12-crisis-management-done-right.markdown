Customer satisfaction is a key metric in any customer-facing business. Some businesses - such as [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/) - have taken it further and made it their number one [leadership principle](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Values-Careers/b?ie=UTF8&node=203039011). As a side note, I can proudly say that my most recent engagement [Loveknitting](http://www.loveknitting.com/) is one of them. To ensure customer satisfaction businesses work hard to deliver their promise in advance in the hope that no complications or complaints arise.

However it is never hundred percent perfect and things go wrong.  The customer experience is damaged which is especially difficult to amend for first-time customers. Affected customers can easily become defensive and sensible. Constructive communication is often not possible. Nonetheless managing these crises is the last chance for the business to make good or yet leave such an impression to the customer that they become more attached to your service than they would, if it went without a complication. Even small gestures and courtesies can enjoy a significant reception - people in a difficult situation usually tend to appreciate it.

This week I got surprised by the way [Thames Water](http://www.thameswater.co.uk/) managed a tap water issue in my neighbourhood. On Wednesday my wife and me came back from a get-together and found a notice on our flat door, stating that the tap water is not drinkable anymore. It further explains what is safe to do such as washing clothes or bathing but not cooking or brushing your teeth, even after the water is boiled. My wife did notice a strange odour from the tap earlier that day but did not worry about it much. As stated I found the issue on their website with some more information about it.

On the notice it was also written that alternative supplies will be available nearby. We could not imagine what that will look like. We use [Brita filters](http://www.brita.co.uk/) so did not have any drinkable water supplies at home. The next day my wife went to Tesco and got a six-pack, carried it all the way home. Two hours later - when arriving from work - I was awed. Maybe fifteen palettes of six-packs were located in the parking lot of the gated development. This was very convenient. The bottles were labelled with "Drinking Water - We're really sorry you're without water".

I found another notice on our door the day after. It was a letter explaining the whole issue. It stated that on Wednesday a technician visited the area to investigate in response to residents complaints regarding an unusual odour. They found very low levels of a diesel like substance which in these levels do not pose a risk to health. Initial actions would be finished the next morrow but requires cooperation of residents to flush all taps for a minimum of 10 minutes. Further notice would be given after the issue is finally cleared.

I lived in many cities and have never seen such a good example of communication let alone alternative supply by a local service provider. Thanks Thames Water for being nice despite being busy with the [recent floods](http://www.thameswater.co.uk/help-and-advice/16739.htm).
