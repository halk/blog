Last week I [wrote](http://halilkoklu.de/blog/crisis-management-done-right/) about Thames Water and its crisis management with an issue in our neighbourhood. While writing that I got reminded by another good experience I had namely with [Emirates Airlines](http://www.emirates.com/).

As a customer it is not often that you really get individual attention. This is much more true in an environment such as restaurants where there are many customers around and expecting attention all at the same time.

This dates back to August 2012. The day before [Rocket Internet](http://www.rocket-internet.de/) [shut down](http://venturevillage.eu/rocket-internet-to-shut-down-turkey-operations) its operations in Turkey and laid off more than 400 employees - amongst them friends. Our Dubai ventures were from an infrastructure point of view depending on the Turkey branch which was now unmanned. I got on the phone with one of the Managing Directors in Dubai and eventually decided that it was best if I fly to Istanbul and do a hand over. We booked a ticket with Emirates Airlines. The flight was in 3 hours so I was rushed when I arrived. It was not a happy occasion either.

While boarding the plane I noticed that it was fully booked. As one of the last minute passengers I found myself in the second last row of a Boeing 777ER with more than 350 passenger capacity. After some time the cabin crew started the catering. It was the last day of [Ramadan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan), the Islamic month of fasting. I did not know that I was going to travel - travellers are excempt from fasting - so in the early morning I committed myself to fast this day. When a crew member was up to hand me over a tray I gratefully declined. I was unprepared to his question if I was fasting. I affirmed and he went on with his duty. Three more hours passed and we finally landed in Istanbul. The 350 passengers made all their way to the front of the plane very slowly. When I was just stepping out, I got surprised by someone who handed a bag to me. I identified him as the crew member from before. He told me that this was for me for breaking my fast. Flattered by his service and that he remembered me I thanked. This made my day.

I arrived at the office, did initial arrangements, found a place to stay when the [cannon shot](http://english.alarabiya.net/en/special-reports/ramadan-2013/2013/07/21/Keeping-alive-the-tradition-of-the-Ramadan-Cannon-.html) and [adhan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhan) sounded. I was too tired to go and find a restaurant - they are usually booked in advance anyway so I thankfully broke my fast with the box I got. On the morrow - the Islamic holiday [Eid al-Fitr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Fitr) - I eventually found myself praying in the [most magnificient mosque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BCleymaniye_Mosque) in Turkey, listening to the [Prime Minister](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdo%C4%9Fan) in person and celebrating with family.
