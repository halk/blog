Although the short answer is **yes**, there is more to consider. Since I have assumed management responsibilities in my career I remained hands-on and involved as a developer. Even though I had predominantly positive experiences, being a coding manager comes with problems. Reflecting on these four years the following advice comes to my mind:

## Be a good manager first

I recommend any technical manager to cogitate about their daily activities in their job from a birds-eye perspective. What is expected from your role and position in the company? Does it match what you are doing? In the end, you will be measured against these expectations. If you are busy doing the work of a developer and neglect your actual responsibilities, then your work would still be appreciated but your overall success in the role will suffer. When time comes that the company grows, you might be seen not ready to manage a larger team or project.

I deliberately chose not to name a particular role such as CTO in the topic, as I think that this involves any managerial position overseeing the work of a technical project or system. A coding CEO is a cool thing but if the business goes diving or salaries are neglected to be paid then those nice code lines will not suffice even in the eyes of their developers.

## Be a user of the technology

This is something I wish I had the time to do periodically. It is really important for the manager to be a user of the overseen technology and systems - both in front- and backend. Spend a few hours in customer service, manage content or make a purchase as a customer. I assume that you already do certain things while testing on staging environments by choosing somewhat random product but you will rarely approach it with the psychological view of a real customer searching for an idea of a product.

A few months into my role as CTO at Namshi I was representing the company in an exhibition and approached actual, real customers - not just numbers in Google Analytics - to show them the website. There the founders Louis and Muhammed asked me why I have not bought anything from Namshi yet. I was certainly shocked as I did not see it from that perspective yet. Admittedly I am not a typical consumer of the fashion industry but I still need a pair of shoes from time to time. Now at LoveCrafts, I am regularly buying knitting supplies.

## Know your way around the technology

As a manager of a technical project, you should definitely know the technology in detail. Understand its strengths, weaknesses and especially limitations. Latter is important to apprehend the complexity the team is facing when challenges strain these limitations. It is good for you to know how to make changes. You will have a stronger authority over the team. When they know that anytime you can roll up your sleeves and do the task yourself, they will respect you and will not talk bullshit.

I recommend that you allow yourself a fixed time period to do development work on the technology in the beginning. Furthermore periodically participate in bug hunting or architectural design sessions to keep yourself up-to-date.

## Code to enable the team

In the previous paragraph I emphasised the importance of mastering the technology. You might love coding a lot. But hear me that enabling others to work more efficiently is the ultimate joy. There will always be too much work to do in the backlog. It is easy to get used to fight short-term fires. Instead you should spend your time to tune processes, documentation and automation. [Even in smaller teams it is important to automate](/blog/does-it-make-sense-for-small-teams-to-automate/). Continuously improve the communication within the team. This is essential to scale. If these processes are proper then they will work for any team size. In example, if almost all pull requests are rejected due to coding standard issues, then it is a sign to integrate a code sniffer in a pre-commit hook. If the team encounters deployment issues, then work on a stable deployment script.

In my recent experience I have treated myself as a joker whenever there were resourcing problems. Sometimes I was so concentrated tackling the backlog that I may have neglected the team. With hindsight I think that I should have avoided relying on such workarounds and spent more time on the root causes - in the previous example e.g. streamlining the roadmap with the resourcing capacity in hand and improve the velocity of the team.

## Think ahead and involve the team

As a technical manager it is important that you have a constant view on the medium- and long-term development of the technology. At the same time yo should know the level of technical debt and bugs. Do your own research but definitely invite the team to discuss. By involving the team you share the excitement and commitment.

Refactoring software is a good practice. However do it without strongly denigrating the old solution. Chances are that the team was involved in that. If there is a major challenge, do not lock yourself up and return with the solution excluding the team or dictate your approach. This would proof that you are not trusting your team.
